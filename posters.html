<h1>Krapperup's farm museum</h1>

<p>In the early part of the 1900's there were some 50 people employed on the Krapperup estate.  Without this workforce, the estate could not keep up with demands.  As early as 1951, horses and their equipment was replaced by tractors and new forms of mechanisation. As a result a reduced workforce was needed.  </p>

<p> Service in the castle still required a large staff, to carry wood and coke, water, food and deal with waste. Water and heating pipes were installed in teh castle in 1930. This made it possible to  reduce the workforce.  Life during the early 1900's, when a large family and a lot of guests lived at the castle changed preceptably in the following 50 years.   </p>
