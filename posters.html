<h1>Krapperup's farm museum</h1>

<p>In the early part of the 1900's there were some 50 people employed on the Krapperup estate. Despite this workforce, the estate could not keep up with demands.  As early as 1951, horses and theior equipment was replaced by tractors and new forms of mechanisation which. As a result a reduced workforce was needed.  </p>

<p>Research collaborations are actively encouraged, and interested parties are asked to contact us to discuss needs.  </p>

<p>We have a special interest in quantification aspects of imaging which are particularly helpful in data generation for research projects.  </p> 

<p>The unit is situated primarily at Copenhagen University's Frederiksberg campus but has some of its facilities at the University campus in Taastrup. </p>

<p>Arrangements with the unit can be at the level of co-applicants on research grants, collaborators in existing projects or as contract researchers.  The charge structure will vary depending on the nature of the research relationship, but in all cases has to cover time charges for the personnel and equipment used.   </p>

<p>Clinical services provided include interpretation of veterinary medical (including research) images, image analysis and technical assistance for patients in house also as a service for external referring veterinarians.</p>


<p>The section has its home page at <a href= 'www.ku.dk'>www.ku.dk</a> and can be contacted directly at +45 or via email at <a href=mailto:rontgen@sund.ku.dk>rontgen@sund.ku.dk</a>. </p>

<h2>Collaboration with the Danish Kennel Club</h2>
<h3>Courses</h3>
<p>The section provide a film evaluation service for the hip, shoulder and elbow screening programs operated by the Danish Kennel Club.</p>

<p>Courses are provided on a regular basis for veterinarians participating in these screening schemes. <em>Information of the Current HD/AD course is available <a target="_blank" href="hdadkursus.htm">here</a></em>
</p>



<h3>Uploading screening images for evaluation</h3>

<p>The section uses DICOM images for image evaluation.  These image files will have the file extension  ".dcm" in their file name.  Currently DICOM images are received via DVD format sent to the address below. Due to changes in the postal service and replacement of DVD file transfer by cloud file transfer services, transfer of images by DVD will be phased out in the coming years. </p> 

<p>As an alternative to image transfer by DVD, veterinarians are welcome to send their DICOM images via email as file attachments to,  <a href=mailto:dkk@sund.ku.dk>dkk@sund.ku.dk</a>. The section can receive up to 50 MBytes per mail in file attachments (Please note that DICOM images are large, 7 to 16 MBytes is typical). Please send one email per Danish Kennel Club Sags Number (i.e. one set of attachments each for hips, shoulder and elbow evaluations).  Do not send multiple images of one region; send only images you wish to be evaluated.  </p>

<p>An arrangement with a file sharing service that is in accordance with current EU General Data Protection Regulations is currently under negotiation and details of file transfer via that route will be made available here. </p>
