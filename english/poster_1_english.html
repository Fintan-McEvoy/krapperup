<h1><script> document.write(num);</script>. Krapperup's farm museum</h1>

<p>In the early part of the 1900's there were some 50 people employed on the Krapperup estate.  Without this workforce, the estate could not keep up with demands.  As early as 1951, horses and their equipment were replaced by tractors and new forms of mechanisation. As a result a reduced workforce was needed.  </p>

<p> Service within the castle however still required a large staff, to carry wood and coke, water, food and deal with waste. Water and heating pipes were installed in the castle in 1930. This made it possible to reduce the workforce again.  Life during the early 1900's, when a large family and a lot of guests lived at the castle, changed perceptibly in the following 50 years.   </p>

<p>The contents of this exhibition are taken from the collection of items saved by Baroness Wanda Gyllenstierna (1917 - 1982) for the purpose of creating a museum.  She did not live to see her museum become reality during her lifetime, but a few years after her death an exhibition focusing on Krapperup and Kullabygden was opened just next to the present art gallery here at Krapperup.  The exhibition has since been rebuilt and shows the district from the ice age to present and also the owners of Krapperup estate through the centuries. The exhibition is an introduction to Krapperup as a place of interest and has the same entry and opening times as the gallery.</p>

<p>This farm museum was opened more recently, as part of the 50 year anniversary of Gyllensteirn Krapperup Trust in 2017. Here we present activities and history at Krapperup in the period  50 years prior to the formation of the trust in 1967. It shows the life of the employees, and their activities in the castle, farm, forest and park. The museum's conserved item collection is far from complete but it is complemented with pictures and stories that together should show the industrial economy on the Krapperup estate in the period 1910 to 1960.</p>

<p>Detailed insights can be gained from Lillemor Nystr&#246m's dissertation "I skuggan av en borg.  Vardag och fest p&#229 Krapperups borg 1881-1995", which builds on interviews with employees, and also from other books available at the reception.</p>
